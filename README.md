# Editmode for React

### Description
Editmode allows you to turn plain text in your React app into easily inline-editable bits of content that can be managed by anyone with no technical knowledge.

### Installation
Use npm to install Editmode:
```
npm install editmode-react
```

### Usage
#### Step 1:
   Within your React app, navigate to index.js within your src directory.
   Import the Editmode wrapper and wrap your App within.
   Eg:
   
   ```
   import { Editmode } from "editmode-react";
   
   ReactDOM.render(
     <React.StrictMode>
        <Editmode>
           <App />
        </Editmode>
     </React.StrictMode>,
   document.getElementById("root")
   );
   ```
#### Step 2:  
#### Creating a chunk:
  Import the Editmode "Chunk" component to any file that you would like to make editable.
  
  ```
  import { Chunk } from "editmode-react";
  ```
  
  If you are using one of our text editor plugins, you may select a piece of text and hit CMD+SHIFT+L.
  For Visual Studio Code users, you can also hit CMD+SHIFT+P to open the command pallete, type "Editmode: Create Chunk" and hit enter.
  
  
  That's it - you can now edit and save changes to your selected piece of content from within the browser!
